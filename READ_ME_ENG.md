This program is in the programming language VB,
demonstrates the formula for calculating the volume of a cylindrical horseshoe using VB language,
where to plot the dependence of the volume V on the angle u, if a, b and r are known, a and u change
in the range from u (1) to u (2) with an error step u equal to 0.125
The main Module1 module contains a single main function.
